Completed AWS's[ Practical Data Science with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.aws.training/Transcript/CompletionCertificateHtml?transcriptid=qGP9dVve9kGxP6D17cJbdw2)

Helpful SageMaker blog's I got from the course:

-[Model hosting patterns in Amazon SageMaker, Part 1: Common design patterns for building ML applications on Amazon SageMaker
](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/model-hosting-patterns-in-amazon-sagemaker-part-1-common-design-patterns-for-building-ml-applications-on-amazon-sagemaker/)

-[Model hosting patterns in Amazon SageMaker, Part 2: Getting started with deploying real time models on SageMaker
](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/part-2-model-hosting-patterns-in-amazon-sagemaker-getting-started-with-deploying-real-time-models-on-sagemaker/)

Next I plan to complete [The Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/the-machine-learning-pipeline-on-aws/) followed by [Amazon SageMaker Studio for Data Scientists
](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/amazon-sagemaker-studio-for-data-scientists/) so I can eventually complete [Join the Get AWS Certified: Associate Challenge
](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-ln-GC-Traincert-Associate-Certification-Challenge-Registration-2023.html) to pass [AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty
](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/)
