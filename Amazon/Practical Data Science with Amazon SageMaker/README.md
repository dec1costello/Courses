Completed AWS's [Practical Data Science with Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/practical-data-science-with-amazon-sagemaker/) to get this [Certificate](https://www.aws.training/Transcript/CompletionCertificateHtml?transcriptid=qGP9dVve9kGxP6D17cJbdw2)

Helpful SageMaker blog's I got from the course:

-[Model hosting patterns in Amazon SageMaker, Part 1: Common design patterns for building ML applications on Amazon SageMaker
](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/model-hosting-patterns-in-amazon-sagemaker-part-1-common-design-patterns-for-building-ml-applications-on-amazon-sagemaker/)

-[Model hosting patterns in Amazon SageMaker, Part 2: Getting started with deploying real time models on SageMaker
